Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
Templates (as defined above) and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a work—so that it remains free for all
its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your Templates,
too.

When we speak of free works, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free Templates (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive the source (if any) or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the Templates or use pieces of it
in new free Templates, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the Templates, or if
you modify them: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute verbatim copies of such a Template,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source (if applicable). And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the Templates, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free Template. For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the Templates inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users’ freedom to change the Templates. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every work is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
Templates on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free Template could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the Templates non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as masks for printed circuit boards or other design data.

“The Templates” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a Template means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
Template in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version”
of the earlier Template or a work “based on” the earlier Template.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Templates or a work based
on the Templates.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

#### 1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a Template means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. But it does not include the work’s System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the work.

The “Corresponding Source” need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

#### 2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Templates, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Templates. The output from running a
covered Templates is covered by this License only if the output,
given its content, constitutes a covered Templates. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided
by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered Templates that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in effect. You may convey covered Templates to others for the sole
purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or
provide you with facilities for running those Templates, provided that
you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material
for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
the covered Templates for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,
under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

#### 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered Templates shall be deemed part of an effective technical
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered Templates, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technical measures to the extent such circumvention is
lawful under this License and other applicable law.

#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Templates’ source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-original copyright notices apply to the Templates; keep intact all
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
of this License along with the Templates.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Templates, or the modifications to
produce it from the Templates, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under
     section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4
     to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     variant or modified versions of it, and you must make sure that the
     whole of the work is licensed under this License and not any
     other license. This License gives no permission to license the
     work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
     permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; if the Templates have interactive GUIs,
     each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; if the Templates do
     not have any interactive user interfaces, this requirement does
     not apply.

A compilation of covered Templates with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered Templates,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger entity, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users
beyond what the individual works permit. In such a case, you may
convey the aggregate under terms of your choice, provided that you
do not thereby convey the covered Templates itself in a form which
violates any of the terms of this License.

#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey covered Templates in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
     third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
     copy of the Corresponding Source, to be distributed under these
     terms.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
     third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
     copy of the Corresponding Source, to be distributed under these
     terms.

     c) Accompany the object code with the Corresponding Source
     in the same physical product.

     d) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
     and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in
     accord with subsection 6b.

     e) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
     the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
     place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to
     copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If
     the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
     Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
     you or a third party) that supports equivalent access
     functionality.

     f) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the Templates are being offered to the public at no
     charge under subsection 6e.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not
be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product,” which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common
use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
user or the way in which the particular user uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  
 “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered Templates in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified Templates
is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey Templates in, or with, or on a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), and the conveyed product is a User Product,
and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of
possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must
be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does
not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the Templates have
been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a Template that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. However, you
must provide the Recipients with access to the Corresponding Source of a
Template that has been modified if you concurrently provide support or updates
for that Template. Provide equivalent support for released modified Template
projects, however they are distributed.

#### 7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that grant additional rights
beyond the scope of this License. Additional permissions that are
applicable to the entire Templates shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under
applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Templates, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but
the entire Templates remain governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered Templates, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.

(Additional terms that are applicable to the entire Templates would
be treated as included in this License. You may remove them if you
wish, but if you do, you must make it clear to the recipient that you
removed those additional permissions.)

#### 8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered Templates except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph
of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Templates. Ancillary propagation of a covered Templates
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing else grants you permission to propagate or modify the
Templates or its derivative works. These actions infringe copyright if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
covered Templates, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered Templates, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that Templates, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all of its assets, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
Templates results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the Templates also receives whatever
licenses to the Templates the party’s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the Templates from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor had it or could get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing or otherwise running, modifying or propagating a covered
Templates or any portion of it.

#### 11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Templates or a work on which the Templates is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.

A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express covenant not to sue). To “grant” such a patent
license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment
not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered Templates, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the Templates is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge, through a publicly available network server or
other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
Templates, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
“Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent
license, your conveying the covered Templates in a country, or your recipient’s ability
to run the covered Templates in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
patent claims in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If,
however, you convey a covered Templates, and meet all conditions of this section, then
you may rely on a patent license present in the recipient solely to convey that
Templates, and you do not need to seek additional patent licenses.

If you convey a covered Templates, and grant a patent license to some of
the parties receiving the covered Templates, that patent license is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered Templates and
Templates derived from it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
either (a) specifically granted under this License or (b) specifically
denied by this License. You may not convey a covered Templates if you are a
party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
distributing Templates, under which you make payment to the third party
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the Templates, and under
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive
the covered Templates from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered Templates conveyed by you (or copies
of any Templates derived from the covered Templates), or (b) primarily for
and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered Templates, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be interpreted as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

#### 12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement, or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered Templates so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
Templates, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Templates.

#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered Templates with a Templates licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered Templates,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Templates specify that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Templates do not
specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may
choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
Foundation.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE TEMPLATES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE TEMPLATES “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TEMPLATES IS WITH YOU.  
SHOULD THE TEMPLATES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY  
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

#### 16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE TEMPLATES AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE TEMPLATES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE TEMPLATES TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER TEMPLATES),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Templates, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Templates in
return for a fee.

**END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS**
